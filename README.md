From now on this will serve as an message board about issues that I can't fix
# ytdl-core issue
https://github.com/fent/node-ytdl-core/issues/659
This may cause issues with playing music for too long
# 429 issues
I'm looking into a possible fix. The traffic coming from this is equivilent to a normal users traffic so I shouldn't be getting blocked. Update: adding your own cookies should solve the issue but I think I got blocked because too many people were using the public version which resulted in 429 or someone just left it on in the background too long
# Cloudflare compatility
Looks like cloudflare might not work with this because it leaves a request open for a very long time
